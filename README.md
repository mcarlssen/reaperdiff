https://reaperdiff.app ðŸŽ‰ - a fast, easy-to-use Reaper project file comparison app to help you ensure no unexpected changes slip through review, without lengthy human audible review!

Using the app is simple: upload separate ver.1 and ver.2 Reaper project files, and click "Compare files"! Reaperdiff will detect your changes, classify them into 5 different types, and display an easy-to-understand visual representation of your revised timeline. 

Hover over any clips in the timeline to view the analysis details, or download the results as CSV - and if the algorithm missed a change you expected, send us feedback in 2 clicks!

This app is privacy-first and 100% FREE: no signup or personal data required (or ever collected!). We don't even use cookies (but we love chocolate chip...).
