- allow users to set their own colors for clips (and be persistent, w/ browser storage)
- automated testing against new feature changes
- is there a way to detect and mark portions of now-split clips, which were present in the original, as unchanged?
- convert logging to use pino, winston, or similar

- "send this dataset for analysis" which packages control+revised and sends to email via sendgrid or other
